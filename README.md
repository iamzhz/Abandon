# Abandon
It is a program for a programming language named `Abandon`.
> I believe all China's English learners can spell it. So I named it `Abandon`, but that doesnâ€™t mean I intend to abandon the project.

This project is WIP.
You can see more about it [here](https://iamzhz.github.io/t/).  It was written by Chinese.
